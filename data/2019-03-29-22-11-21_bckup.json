Happy learning. \n\nERRATA below -- \n\n5:05 - Instances from other customers or shared instances (from you) can't sit on this physical host\n\n7:48 - You need to pay for the full physical host, as you are blocking the full host.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nUPDATE May 2017: \n\nThere is a change which happened in May 2017 as I am able to find out. Please refer following links  to read further: \n\nhttp://cloudcheckr.com/2017/05/aws-hipaa-non-dedicated-instances/\n\nhttps://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_HIPAA_Compliance_Whitepaper.pdf  (LAST PAGE of PDF)\n\nIn May 2017, AWS declared that your application could be HIPAA complied even when you run it on Shared instances (you don't necessarily need Dedicated instances anymore for HIPAA compliance). Post this, the other restriction has been dropped. Now, shared instances in your account can run on the host where your dedicated instance is running. \n\nEarlier the isolation was from 2 things: \n1. Instances of other AWS account \n2. Instances which are not dedicated instances.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nI would request to look at our playlists to learn systematically for AWS Certifications --- \nSolutions Architect - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywHFXfuJoSU&list=PLTyrc6mz8dg8YE7OpHYoaRILnf1RQM8bz    \n&&&     \nSysOps Administrator - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFSH-KuDGj8&list=PLTyrc6mz8dg8grU1HEhVw4zoCyvAl5MBO \n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nI have answered lot of AWS Interview questions in LIVE sessions here -- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTyrc6mz8dg_tEexS22k_gmssDmkWkEMd \n\nConnect with me on LinkedIn to read interesting AWS updates & Practical Scenario Questions --- https://www.linkedin.com/in/knowledgeindia \n\nDon't miss any updates, please follow my FB page http://fb.me/AWStutorials   \n&   \nTwitter -  http://twitter.com/#!/knowledge_india \n\nAnd for AWS exercises & case-studies, you can refer our blog -- https://aws-tutorials.blogspot.com/ \n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++",
